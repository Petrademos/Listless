Sometimes parts of the image move; sometimes they don't. The people in these scenes are drawn in the same style as their background, unfocused and flat. They include:","\n","^High schoolers loitering in the afternoon, in the no-man's-land of the parking lot between the metro station and the corner store.","\n","^An aproned busboy taking out the trash at midnight, in the narrow back alley of a restaurant. His shoulders sag. He's very tired.","\n","^A sea of commuters thronging the crossing of the train tracks in the morning, then descending into the bowels of the metro.","\n","^In the corner of a bookstore, at an indeterminate time of day, a young child hiding in a corner to read comics, unseen.","\n","^At sunset, a woman walking a long sidewalk. Her steps are heavy, saddled with bags of groceries. But she bounces. She's unburdened.","\n","^A couple of young parents attempting the momentous undertaking of herding young children and all their things back into carriable bags and pusheable strollers, at the end of a playdate. It might be late afternoon.","\n","^A young man taking a phone call he clearly doesn't want to, in a corner of an office sometime during the day. It looks painful.","\n","^Two friends, or two lovers - it's unclear - giggling together on a restaurant terrace at night. It's dark outside, behind the fairy lights. They look very happy.","\n","^A middle-aged woman picking up dog poop on the sidewalk during the morning walk. The dog sniffs a nearby bush.","\n","^The frame pans sideways over each of these in a near-unbroken sequence, until a specific building comes into view. It looks odd, but not immediately odd. It's a little squished between the duplex and the triplex on either side, like it's only been left the space to house a single room per floor. The frame focuses in on the third floor, on its singular room, till the walls melt away and its insides are all that's left. It's very empty, and very symmetrical. There's a bed in the middle, in an alcove underneath a window, and shelves on either side. There are no sheets - just a bare pillow and a comforter, neatly folded. Nothing on the shelves.","\n","^The music becomes lighter, more pensive, and idle. A piece of text overlays the room. The first line disappears after a few seconds, to make room for the last two, which arrive in tandem:","\n","^\"This is the House","\n","^Care for it well","\n","^It will care for you back\"","\n","^The text disappears.","\n",{"->":"Shrine"},{"#f":1}],"Shrine":[["^In the empty room, there's not yet much to do.
